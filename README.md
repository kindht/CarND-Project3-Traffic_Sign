This is the 3rd project for the **Self-Driving Car Engineer** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer--nd013)

The project used **deep neural networks** and **Convolutional Neural Networks** to classify traffic signs.

The project implemented classical **LeNet** Architecture using **TensorFlow**

The steps involved in this project are the following:

* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
