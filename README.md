This is the 3rd project in the course of Self-Driving Car at Udacity

The project used deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs

The steps involved in this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
